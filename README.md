## Overview

A minimal implementation of the random ray method for neutral particle transport.

Key Features:
  - Much simpler than the full application (ARRC) -- allowing it to act as a reference implementation
  - Simplified geometry treatment can simulate 2D heterogeneous Cartesian geometries
  - Hard coded reactor simulation problem of interest: 2D C5G7
  - Single node performance analysis
  - Kernelized for easy porting to accelerator languages
