# minray

## Overview

A minimal implementation of the random ray method for neutral particle transport. This purpose of this code is to serve as an open source performance benchmark for random ray, while still being able to perform the real neutronics and produce real solutions.

Key Features:
  - Much simpler than the full application (ARRC) -- allowing it to act as a reference implementation
  - Complex enough to converge real solutions to neutron transport problems (see picture below generated with minray)
  - Simplified geometry treatment limits complexity (can only simulate 2D heterogeneous Cartesian geometries)
  - Hard coded reactor simulation problem of interest: 2D C5G7
  - Kernelized for easy porting to accelerator languages
